TODO:
- implement dynamic index page
- implement /keys dynamic page
- redirect to previous url after login (when the user was going to a resource but
  he wasn't logged in)
- implement subscription to a group of keys: gen_server whose state is the list of
  keys to be translated and their state. The developer should be able to get that state
- refactor polish_utils
- rethink polish_server, how data is stored, and refactor it
