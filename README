SETUP
----
- Change hostname: Open the src/polish.app.src and replace the hostname value which is by default
"hostname" with your IP (for example "17.10.100.14"). This is necessary for some redirects that happen
after the login, to avoid being redirected to "localhost".

- Change po_lang_dir: Again in the src/polish.app.src file, you need to replace "/xxx/yyy/priv/lang"
with the path to the directory which contains the languages information. That directory should 
have the next structure: ./custom/${LC}/gettext.po

- Make sure you have a 'polish_users' file. (explained below)

- Make sure you have a gettext.po.meta file per each language (explained below).

- To set up and initialize Polish run:
 make init

- To compile the source code of the polish application run:
 make

- Now, you are ready to start Polish by running:
 ./start.sh



ADDING TRANSLATORS
----
To add translators to Polish first they need an openid account (they can get one in www.myopenid.com).
Once they have an openid, you need to add them in the 'polish_users' file that should be placed
in the po_lang_dir specified in polish.app.src: ${po_lang_dir}/polish_users
An example of the content of this file may be:

% The 'acl' list defines who is allowed to do translations.
{acl, ["http://etnt.myopenid.com/"
      ,"http://jordi-chacon.myopenid.com/"
      ]}.

% The 'users' list connects the OpenID with a Name and Email.
{users,[{"http://etnt.myopenid.com/", [{name, "Torbjorn Tornkvist"},{email, "tobbe@klarna.com"}]},
        {"http://jordi-chacon.myopenid.com/", [{name, "Jordi Chacon"},{email, "jordi.chacon@klarna.com"}]}
        ]}.

If you need to add a translator, you need to add him/her to both 'acl' and 'users' lists 
following the pattern in the example.



GETTEXT.PO.META
----
For each language that you want to translate with polish, you need to add a gettext.po.meta file.
For example, if you have a ${po_lang_dir}/custom/en/gettext.po file for the English language, 
you will need to create a ${po_lang_dir}/custom/en/gettext.po.meta empty file.
The purpose of this file is to store the sentences whose translations look exactly the same as 
in the default language. When a translator marks a sentence as 'Always translated', it will
be added in the meta file of that language and it will not appear again as untranslated.
