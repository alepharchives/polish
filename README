SETUP
----
To set up and initialize Polish run:
 make init

To compile the source code of the polish application run:
 make

Now, you are ready to start Polish by running:
 ./start.sh


ADDING TRANSLATORS
----
To add translators to Polish first they need an openid account (they can get one in www.myopenid.com).
Once they have an openid, you need to add them in the src/polish.app.src file so that they can log in.
Open that file and add the translator information both in the 'acl' tuple and in
the 'users' tuple following the pattern existing for the already existing translators.
When you are done, you need to do the whole setup process again explained above.
