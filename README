SETUP
----
- Change hostname: Open the src/polish.app.src and replace the hostname value which is by default
"hostname" with your IP (for example "17.10.100.14"). This is necessary for some redirects that happen
after the login, to avoid being redirected to "localhost".

- Change po_lang_dir: Again in the src/polish.app.src file, you need to replace "/xxx/yyy/priv/lang"
with the path to the directory which contains the languages information. That directory should 
have the next structure: ./custom/${LC}/gettext.po

- Make sure you have a 'polish.meta' file. (explained below)

- Make sure you have a gettext.po.meta file per each language (explained below).

- To set up and initialize Polish run:
 make init

- To compile the source code of the polish application run:
 make

- Now, you are ready to start Polish by running:
 ./start.sh

- Wash po files


POLISH.META
----
The purpose of the polish.meta file is to store information regarding your project. Specifically, it
should contain:
- List of users allowed to do translations: acl
- Information of each of those users: users
- Your default language code following iso639: default_lang
- Your organisation name: org_name

It is mandatory to have the polish.meta file and it should be placed in the po_lang_dir 
directory specified in polish.app.src: ${po_lang_dir}/polish.meta
An example of the content of this file is presented next:


% The 'acl' list defines who is allowed to do translations.
{acl, ["http://etnt.myopenid.com/"
      ,"http://jordi-chacon.myopenid.com/"
      ]}.
% The 'users' list connects the OpenID with a Name and Email.
{users,[{"http://etnt.myopenid.com/", [{name, "Torbjorn Tornkvist"},{email, "tobbe@klarna.com"}]},
        {"http://jordi-chacon.myopenid.com/", [{name, "Jordi Chacon"},{email, "jordi.chacon@klarna.com"}]}
        ]}.
{default_lang, "sv"}.
{org_name, "Klarna AB Sweden"}.




ADDING TRANSLATORS
----
To add translators to Polish first they need an openid account (they can get one in www.myopenid.com).
Once they have an openid, you need to add them in the 'polish.meta'. Specifically, you need to 
add him/her to both 'acl' and 'users' fields following the pattern in the previous example.




GETTEXT.PO.META
----
For each language that you want to translate with polish, you need to add a gettext.po.meta file.
For example, if you have a ${po_lang_dir}/custom/en/gettext.po file for the English language, 
you will need to create a ${po_lang_dir}/custom/en/gettext.po.meta empty file.
The purpose of this file is to store the sentences whose translations look exactly the same as 
in the default language. When a translator marks a sentence as 'Always translated', it will
be added in the meta file of that language and it will not appear again as untranslated.
